<p><b>Wiped bearing</b><br>
A wiped bearing is where rubbing, melting and smearing in the surface is evident. Wiping may be due to the following causes:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Loss of Clearance</b><br>
Wiping of bearing surfaces can occur due to the tight clearances on a unit that has to start up from cold. The heat generated 
in the oil may increase the shaft temperature faster than the bearing housing, causing a reduction in the bearing clearance due to the 
differential expansion of the shaft. It is very important to maintain the recommended design clearance to suit operating conditions. 
<li><b>Misalignment</b><br>
When the shaft and bearing surfaces are misaligned, a disruption of the oil film at the edge of the bearing creates a parabolic-shaped wipe
in the bearings. This creates wipe marks at one side only; if it is a slight wipe, the bearing can continue in operation, as generally
the wipe will stabilize and not get progressively worse. In worst cases, the bearing will need to be replaced and the alignment of the unit corrected.
<li><b>Excessive Load at Start-up</b><br>
Wiping may occur due to excessive load at start-up or run-down. An alternatively to this problem may be fitting a larger bearing 
to handle the loads.
<li><b>Insufficient Lubricant</b><br>
A wiped bearing surface may be due to inadequate or interrupted oil supply. Bearings require a constant supply of oil at start-up 
and during operation for lubrication and heat removal. To prevent bearing damage ensure that the oil supply is adequate and continuous.
<li><b>Operational Overload</b><br>
Wiping may occur after disruption of the oil film due to vibration of the shaft that applies a considerably large rotating load to the bearing.
Removing the source of the vibration may be required if changes to the bearing materials is not an option.
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
<b>Specific case</b><br>
After a visual inspection during disassembly, the bearings at G5 did not show signs of wiping. Some areas revealed some rubbing but all within
what is considered normal wear.<br><br>
